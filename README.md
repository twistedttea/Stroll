# Hello bro.
## Instructions
This requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

This also requires an .env file, which is purposefully ignored in every commit. \
**Please** do not force it in, just grab it from the discord on first clone and you should be good to go.

While inside of the root of the project, please ->
``` sh
docker compose up -d --build
```

To stop the server
``` sh
docker compose down
```
